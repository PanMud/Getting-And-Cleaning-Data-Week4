This is the script that performs the cleaning and tidying of the dataset as described in the excercise and listed below.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Creates a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Writes the tidy data set to a file

This file assumes that datazip file has been downloaded and unzipped.
